WordPress prefix changer
========================

Simple shell script to change your WP database prefix

Run `wp_prefix_change.sh` and follow the prompts.

All you need are the path to your `wp-config.php` file and a string for your new prefix.

Backing up your database and `wp-config.php` file before conversion is highly recommended, and the script will optionally backup both before changing the prefix.
